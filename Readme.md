EASE
====

Overview
---------------------
This is a repo with functions that can score arbitrary free text and numeric predictors.
This is licensed under the AGPL, please see LICENSE.txt for details.
The goal here is to provide a high-performance, scalable solution that can predict targets from arbitrary values.

Note that this is the basic library code modified from the original EASE algorithm implementation as part of edx-lra.

To run sample on kaggle training and test set, run 

$python ease/run_EASE.py

Detail documentation of the algorithm used, parameters set for tuning and system description is placed in the pages document at docs/
